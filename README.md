# calendar
Just a quick javascript calendar

I'm new to coding and was trying to make a calendar.  I first tried using Django but my skill level wasn't quit there yet.

I'm hoping to eventually connect this calendar to a database.

It is setup to go from 2020 to 2030. It uses jquery to select the current month and year and display that to the user. Getting the date, creating the calendar table, etc... are all done with javascript.

Update - December 31, 2020

-Added more bootstrap version 5

-Changed the way the page is loaded using the bootstrap order functions and grid system. Should increase how responsive the page is.

-Early today I made a few update to the Javascript code to add functionality, a function for the error keys to move up or down a month, a function to hit today to bring the user back to current month and have the display date be changed to the current date.

-My formatting and styling are probably terrible, still learning and trying to make my code look a bit neater.
