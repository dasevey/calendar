# calendar
Just a quick javascript calendar

I'm new to coding and was trying to make a calendar.

It is setup to go from 2020 to 2030. It uses jquery to select the current month and year and display that to the user.

Update - December 31, 2020

-Added more bootstrap version 5

-Changed the way the page is loaded using the bootstrap order functions and grid system. Should increase how responsive the page is.
